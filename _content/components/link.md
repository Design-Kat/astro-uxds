# Link

A Link (also known as a hyperlink) is a clickable text element. It may be used for navigation and to trigger an event. Links are visualized to stand out from standard (non-clickable) text.

## Rules of Thumb

- Choose text for Links that: - Tell the user what will happen when clicking the link. - Hint at the deeper content the Link will reveal.
- Keep the text for Links short. Short links are more visually scannable.

::: note
Avoid using "Click Here," or "Link."

## Examples

![Do: Use Astro defined color for links ](/img/components/links-do.png 'Do: Use Astro defined color for links ')

![Don’t: use underlines on links](/img/components/links-dont.png 'Don’t: use underlines on links')

::: compliance

- 5.8.2 Links shall use a text style that is without an underline.
