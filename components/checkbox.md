# Checkbox

A Checkbox describes a state or value that can be either “On or Off.” Checkboxes are not mutually exclusive. More than one Checkbox may be checked at the same time.

## Code Test

Why isn't it showing up

```
for var
```

## Rules of Thumb {.rules-of-thumb}

- Use Checkboxes when there is a list of options from which the user may select any number of choices.
- In a list, each Checkbox is independent of all other Checkboxes.
- When asking the user to make a mutually exclusive choice, use a Radio Button not a Checkbox.
- Group Checkboxes whenever possible.

## Appearance and Behavior

A checkbox can be configured for required input. [See Form and Input Validation](./validation/).

::: note
Don’t use a Checkbox to initiate an action. Instead, use an [Action Button](../button) or a [Toggle Button](./toggle)

### Do {.dos}

- Do: Neatly arrange and group multiple Checkboxes whenever possible.

### Don't {.donts}

- Don’t: Poorly placed and misaligned Checkboxes make it difficult for users to differentiate one state from another.
