# Pagination

::: note
Be sure the current page is easily distinguishable from other pages referenced by the Pagination.
:::

## Rules of Thumb

- Don’t underline links.
- Use Pagination only when necessary. Instead, think about editing the content to fit onto one page.
- Make each page a similar length.
- If there is only one page, no Pagination is needed.

## Appearance and Behavior

## Examples

![Offer a “Prev” and “Next” link where useful.](/img/components/pagination-1.png 'Offer a “Prev” and “Next” link where useful.')
Offer a “Prev” and “Next” link where useful.

![Disable the “Prev” link when there are no more pages before the first numeral displayed.](/img/components/pagination-2.png 'Disable the “Prev” link when there are no more pages before the first numeral displayed.')
Disable the “Prev” link when there are no more pages before the first numeral displayed.

![Disable the “Next” link when there are no more pages after the last numeral displayed.](/img/components/pagination-3.png 'Disable the “Next” link when there are no more pages after the last numeral displayed.')
Disable the “Next” link when there are no more pages after the last numeral displayed.

## Pagination of Search Results

![Optionally, links for “Show All” and “Number of Results” may be displayed below page numbers. Links are centered below the Pagination on the same baseline.](/img/components/pagination-4.png)
When user selects the “Show All” link, all Search results should display in a continuous list.

![When there are no Search results, suggest that the user amend the Search.](/img/components/pagination-5.png)
The “Amend Search” link takes user back to the text entry field for Search.
